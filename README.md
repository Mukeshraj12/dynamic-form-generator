      "label": "Username",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter your username"

      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "you@example.com",
      "validation": {
        "pattern": "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$",

    }
  ]
}
```

You can copy and paste this schema into the JSON editor in the app to see the generated form.
